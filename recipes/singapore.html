    <p><strong>Singapore-style Noodles <em>(星洲炒米)</em></strong> is a dish of stir-fried cooked rice vermicelli, curry powder, vegetables, scrambled eggs, shrimps and <em>char siu</em>. Singapore noodles are a cantonese creation, and are common in cantonese-style and takeaway restaurants in Hong Kong. The dish dates back to just after World War II, having been developed by cantonese chefs who wanted ways to use curry powder, which had been introduced through the british colonies.</p>
